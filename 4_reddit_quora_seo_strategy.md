**Template 2: Educational with Subtle Mention**

*Question: "Benefits of combining pilates with gym workouts?"*

- Reduced injury risk through enhanced mobility

**Performance Benefits:**
- Improved functional movement patterns
- Better balance and coordination
- Enhanced mind-muscle connection

**Practical Implementation:**
I typically recommend 2-3 gym sessions + 1-2 pilates sessions per week. The key is finding a facility that offers both so you can maintain consistency.

At the studio where I train [casual mention of housed.com.au], we see members get much better results when they combine both modalities rather than focusing on just one.

[Detailed workout integration advice]
